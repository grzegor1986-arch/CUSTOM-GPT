# CUSTOM-GPT

A lightweight workspace for experimenting with custom GPT behaviors and prompts. This repository currently contains scaffolding for future automation and serves as a starting point for small utilities or notebooks.

## Getting started
1. Ensure you have Python 3.11 or later installed.
2. Create and activate a virtual environment (e.g., `python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate`).
3. Install any project dependencies as they are added.

## Development
- Commit changes in small, reviewable increments.
- Keep configuration files under version control and avoid committing secrets.
- Use `.gitignore` to keep transient artifacts out of the repository.

## Contributing
Issues and pull requests are welcome as the project grows. Please include clear descriptions of any changes or ideas for new functionality.
